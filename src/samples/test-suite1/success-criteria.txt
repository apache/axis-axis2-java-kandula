TestSuite1- Success criteria for each test
------------------------------------------

P: Participant
CS: Coordination Service
CI: Completion Initiator

(1) TestReadonlyCommit:

P registers for wsat:Durable2PC
CS receives wsat:Commit from CI
P receives wsat:Prepare
CS receives wsat:ReadOnly from P
P does NOT receive wsat:Commit
CI receives wsat:Committed


(2) TestReadonlyRollback:

P registers for wsat:Durable2PC
CS receives wsat:Rollback from CI
P receives wsat:Rollback
CS receives wsat:Aborted from P
CI receives wsat:Aborted


(3) TestRollback:

Same as for 'TestReadonlyRollback'


(4) TestPrepareCommit:

P registers for wsat:Durable2PC
CS receives wsat:Commit from CI
P receives wsat:Prepare
CS receives wsat:Prepared from P
P receives wsat:Commit
CS receives wsat:Committed from P
CI receives wsat:Committed


(5) TestPrepareRollback:

P registers for wsat:Durable2PC *once* after enlistXA_OKOnPrepareResourceOperation
CS receives wsat:Commit from CI
P receives wsat:Prepare
CS receives wsat:Aborted from P
CI receives wsat:Aborted
javax.transaction.RollbackException
        at org.apache.kandula.coordinator.at.TransactionImpl.commit

prepare fails due to XAExceptionOnPrepareXAResource


(6) TestEarlyCommit:

to be documented in future

this scenario tests when the j2ee side commits the local transaction prior to the CI.
the outcome depends on whether the CI is able to register before CS receives wsat:Committed
from P. 


(7) TestEarlyCommit:

to be documented in future

similar to 'TestEarlyCommit' but in this case the j2ee side rollbacks the local transaction
instead of committing.


(8) TestMarkedRollbackCommit:

similar to 'TestPrepareRollback', however in this case the j2ee side marks the local transaction
as RollbackOnly.


(9) TestMarkedRollbackRollback:

similar to 'TestReadonlyRollback', here CI tries to rollback the transaction when the local
transaction has already been marked as RollbackOnly by the j2ee side


(10) TestCommitFailure:

to be documented in future

one of the XAResources fails during the commit phase


(11) TestRollbackFailure:

to be documented in future

one of the XAResources fails during the rollback phase
