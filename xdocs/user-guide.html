<H1>User Guide for Apache Kandula</H1>
<H2>Purpose</H2>
<P>Describe how to deploy Apache Kandula and run the provided sample applications.</P>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>Presently Apache Kandula has 2 branches. The svn trunk named "Kandula2" runs on Apache Axis2. Kandula_1 branch
runs on "Axis 1.x" (henceforth referred to as Apache Axis). Both branches now support the nightly builds of respective Axis flavours.</p>
<H2>Kandula2 branch</H2>

<H2>Kandula_1 branch</H2>
<H3>How to download and build</H3>
<ol>
<LI>Checkout Kandula_1 from the svn repository using an svn client at the following URL:
<a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/webservices/kandula/branches/Kandula_1/">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/webservices/kandula/branches/Kandula_1/</a>.
Let us call the directory to where you checked out Kandula_1, <tt>KANDULA_HOME</tt>.</LI>
<li>Download and install Apache Tomcat. (5.0 or later required).</li>
<li>Download and install Apache Axis (1.3 or later required).</li>
<li>Download and install Apache Maven 1.x (2.0 not supported).</li>
<li>Download and install Apache Ant (1.6.5 or later).</li>
<li>Set the kandula.context property in <tt>%KANDULA_HOME%/src/conf/kandula.properties</tt>, to the context under which
services are deployed in axis. Normally this is: <tt>http://localhost:8080/axis/services/</tt></li>
<li>Build Kandula using Maven. Use the command <tt>maven</tt> in <tt>%KANDULA_HOME</tt>. This will create the directory
<tt>%KANDULA_HOME%/target</tt>. You will find the <tt>kandula-0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar</tt> along with all other required <tt>*.jar</tt>
files in the directory <tt>%KANDULA_HOME%/target/lib</tt>.</li>
<li>To build the sample applications, move to each one of the directories in <tt>%KANDULA_HOME%/src/samples/</tt>
and use the command <tt>ant dist</tt>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to deploy</h3>
<ol>
<li>Move all Apache Axis jars from <tt>%AXIS_DEPLOY%/WEB-INF/lib</tt> to <tt>%TOMCAT_HOME%/shared/lib</tt>.</li>
<li>Move all <tt>geronimo-*.jar</tt> files, <tt>addressing-SNAPSHOT.jar</tt> and <tt>kandula-0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar</tt> to <tt>%TOMCAT_HOME%/shared/lib</tt>.</li>
<li>Copy the <tt>*.jar</tt> file in the <tt>build</tt> directory of each sample application to <tt>%AXIS_DEPLOY%/WEB-INF/lib</tt>.</li>
<li>Copy the <tt>server-config.wsdd</tt> file in <tt>%KANDULA_HOME%/src/conf/</tt> to <tt>%AXIS_DEPLOY%/WEB-INF/</tt>.</li>
<li>Copy the <tt>client-config.wsdd</tt> file in <tt>%KANDULA_HOME%/src/conf/</tt> to <tt>%AXIS_DEPLOY%/WEB-INF/classes</tt>.</li>
<li>Start Tomcat. To assure that Kandula has been properly deployed, first list all deployed services
in Axis from the "Happy Axis" page and then verify that you can view the WSDL of each service.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to run the sample applications</h3>

<p>Sample applications reside in the directory <tt>%KANDULA_HOME%/src/samples</tt>. The Axis artifacts necessary to deploy
all the samples are also included in <tt>%KANDULA_HOME%/src/conf/server-config.wsdd</tt>. Hence unless you deploy the samples
along with Kandula, you need to remove those elements from the <tt>server-config.wsdd</tt> file copied to <tt>%AXIS_DEPLOY%/WEB-INF/</tt> before you
start Tomcat.</p>

<h4>How to setup the TCP sniffer</h4>
<p>The default configuration in Kandula assumes that you will use a TCP sniffer such as the "tcpmon" tool
that comes with Apache Axis to monitor TCP traffic while running the sample applications. We also
assume that Tomcat would be run on port <tt>8080</tt> and services in Axis are deployed under the URL:
<tt>http://localhost:8080/axis/services/</tt>. Hence, to facilitate monitoring of traffic, all Stubs 
in Kandula forward messages that would otherwise be forwarded to port 8080 to port 8081.</p>
<p>Therefore, inorder to run
the samples (or any other application that uses Kandula in the default setting) you MUST forward port 8081
of your local machine to port 8080.</p>
<p>You can change this behaviour by editing the WSDL files in <tt>%KANDULA_HOME%/src/schema/</tt>
and rebuilding Kandula thereafter.</p>

<h4>Test-suite1</h4>
<p>This sample application demostrates how to use Kandula to initiate and terminate transactions using the
WS-AtomicTransaction protocol. It also demostrates the behaviour of Kandula under a number of failure scenarios.
Note that we use pseudo XAResouces instead of actual applications such as Databases, Messaging etc. to simplify
the testing process. Hence the application explicitly enlists all XAResources used in operations. This would
not be the case with real applications however. The container would normally takecare of this for you,
transparently.</p>

<p>The most important aspect of this sample application is that it demostrates how Kandula
can be used to expose transactional resources in a J2EE environment via the web services transaction management
framework. After the revision of code in December 2005, Kandula_1 now supports ONLY the "Geronimo" Transaction Manager.
The required jars are automatically downloaded by Maven during the build process.</p>

<p>To run the sample, first ensure that the transaction handler used in your <tt>%AXIS_DEPLOY%/WEB-INF/classes/client-config.wsdd</tt>
is <tt>org.apache.kandula.geronimo.TxHandler</tt>. Next open up the JUnit test case provided in the <tt>src</tt> directory
in your favourite IDE. This file contains a number of test cases. Each test case should be run on its own. If you run
a number of test cases this would result in a whole lot of messages which would be rather difficult to interpret.
Also note that some of the test scenarios are positive tests while some others are negative. A short description of
the success criteria of most of the test cases can be found in the <tt>success-criteria.txt</tt> file in <tt>%KANDULA_HOME%/src/samples/test-suite1/</tt>.
To run the test cases use the standard JUnit test harness of your IDE.</p>

<h4>InteropIBM</h4>

<p>The objective of this sample application is to test Kandula against IBM WS-AtomicTransaction implementation for
interoperability. For details on interoperability test please refer to the documentation available from: <a href="http://wsi.alphaworks.ibm.com:8080/interop/index.html">http://wsi.alphaworks.ibm.com:8080/interop/index.html</a>
. We suggest that you read through this specification before moving on since some of the terminology is explained in the
specification.</p>

<p>The sample allows you to exercies Kandula in both IA (Initiator Application) and PA (Participant Application) configurations.
We have successfully tested Kandula in IA role against the IBM in PA role for all scenarios except those that involve
WS-Security. Testing under the opposite configuration is still under way. From the tests carried out thus far, Kandula in PA
roles interoperates with IBM successfully in all scenarios upto Section 5.0 of test scenario specification.</p>

<p>To run this sample, you need to use <tt>org.apache.kandula.coordinator.at.TxHandler</tt> in  your <tt>%AXIS_DEPLOY%/WEB-INF/classes/client-config.wsdd</tt>.
Most importantly you MUST have an externally visible URL for your web container. If not, you may setup and HTTP tunnel. However,
in this case you must set the <tt>kandula.context</tt> property to the externally visible URL. If neither option is
available you may still run the sample using Kandula in both IA and PA configurations simultaniously. The resulting
message exchanges SHOULD still comply with the documented success criteria.</p>

<p>Further, in this particular scenario, the Kandula Stubs are pre-configured to forward any messages addressed to
<tt>http://wsi.alphaworks.ibm.com:8080/</tt> to <tt>http://localhost:8082/</tt>. This allows you to monitor all outgoing
traffic. So before you run the sample forward the port 8082 of your local machine to <tt>http://wsi.alphaworks.ibm.com:8080/</tt></p>

<p>To test Kandula in PA role follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Deploy the sample and start Tomcat. Ensure that InteropService is listed (along with its operations) under deployed
services in Axis and that you are able to view the WSDL.</li>
<li>Open the page <a href="http://wsi.alphaworks.ibm.com:8080/wstx/interop.jsp">http://wsi.alphaworks.ibm.com:8080/wstx/interop.jsp</a> in your web browser.</li>
<li>Enter the URL of your "InteropService" as the participant destination. Here, if you want to monitor incoming traffic,
change the port from 8080 to 8081 when entering the URL and forward port 8081 to 8080 as before.</li>
<li>Select the test scenario you want to run. Do not select scenarios from Sections 5.0 or later since these have not
been tested yet under this setting.</li>
<li>Select run test.</li>
</ol>

<p>To test Kandula in IA role, deploy the sample application and setup the TCP sniffer as before.
Thne open up the sample application in your favourite IDE. The code for exercising test scenarios is in <tt>InitiatorApp.java</tt>. You also need a test orchetrator
for some of the scenarios. The test orchestrator can be found in <tt>ManInTheMiddle.java</tt>. Note that when using the test orchestrator you need to setup the TCP monitor differently.
Due to the relative complexity of the process involved we do not document these steps any further. However, things can be
figured out rather quickly by examining the source code.</p>
